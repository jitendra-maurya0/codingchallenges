/**
 * problem statement:
 * you have to implement findCelebrity() to find the celebrity in a party (matrix) using a stack. A celebrity is someone
 * that everyone knows, but he/she doesn’t know anyone at the party.
 * Where party is a variable storing a 2D matrix, which has stored all the information about acquaintances and numPeople,
 * how many people are there in the party?
 *
 * In party matrix, a particular [row][col] stores acquaintance information for row and col. In other words,
 * if [row][col] == 1 then it means row knows col, and if it’s zero then it means row doesn’t know col. Remember
 * that everyone knows a celebrity, but the celebrity doesn’t know the people at the party.
